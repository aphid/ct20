## Course Description

Introduction to basic programming skills, including computer language tools and visual-interface programming tools for creative expression. Introduction to web authoring, image creation and editing, sound editing, and user experience design fundamentals, through skills acquisition-focused approach to individual and/or collaborative creative project(s). The final project is a work of playable media art/design, documentary media, interactive journalism/pedagogy/curation, or multi-media art/performance. Languages and applications will vary by instructor.

## Learning Objectives

## Grading Policy/Assessment

This course will focus on _qualitative_ not quantitative assessment, something we’ll discuss during the class, both with reference to your own work and the works we’re studying. While you will get a final grade at the end of the term, we will not be assigning numeric or alphabetic grades to individual assignments, but rather asking questions and making comments that engage your work rather than simply evaluate it. You will also be reflecting carefully on your own work. The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you’re expected to. If you are worried about your grade, your best strategy should be to participate in class, do the readings, and complete the assignments. You should consider this course a “busy-work-free zone.” If an assignment does not feel productive, come to office hours and we can find ways to modify, remix, or repurpose the instructions.

At the midpoint and end of the quarter, you will write a short self assessment of the work you have done to that point and what has/hasn’t worked for you in the course. Answer to the best of your ability and don’t overthink the process. There are no trick questions.

If this process causes more anxiety than it alleviates, come to office hours at any point to confer with me or the Teaching Assistant about your progress. 

## Course Materials

Aside from your computer, none of the resources needed for this class should cost any money. All course requirements can be made using free, open source tools and services. Readings will either be made available in the files section or from the below open access texts.

## Student Responsibilities

### Attendence

Attendance will be taken at class meetings. Your presence is expected and required. Coding is very often done in isolation. One of the benefits of this class is the experience of sharing and engaging with each other's work, collaborating on projects (optionally), and helping each other when we end up out in the weeds with a technical or conceptual problem. Participation can also happen in the class chatroom (on matrix) during or outside of set course times. 

**More than two unexcused absences will impact your grade.** 

### Readings & Resources

I've included some short readings that give important context to the tools and techniques we're looking at. I've also assigned videos, most of which are from Dan Schiffman's Coding Train. These videos are more for reference; if you learn well from watching this kind of thing and appreciate them, by all means watch them all. But if you learn better from experimentation or reading documentation, do what works for you (the videos will always be there if you need to reinforce a concept). 

### Participation

The most obvious opportunity for participation is during our course exercises, discussions and critiques during class meetings (whether vocally or using the chat), however participation can also occur in our online spaces.

### Camera Policy

Creative Technologies policy is for students to have their camera on during class time.

When coworking (something we'll be doing quite a bit of), you don't need to share your camera, however: I would like you to share the text editor you're coding in (Zoom does allow us to all share screens simultaneously). This is less about me surveilling your activity than about fostering a community where we can see and comment on each other's work, like in a drawing class where one can walk around the room and see how others interpret the same material in different ways. This is an opportunity for peer learning and troubleshooting (i.e., participation).

## Course Assignments

There are four assignments in the course, which are due week 3, week 5, week 7, and week 10. The order in which you complete the assignments is up to you. There is also a final exam.

In addition to assignments there are ungraded exercises that build from resources (videos, talkthroughs, and readings) and in-class lectures/demonstrations. While exercises are ungraded, they can  constitute a portion of your participation grade.

### Weekly Documentation/Reflections

Brief articulations of what you've been up to in the class. Document progress, difficulty, interest, confusion, accomplishments, and/or goals. **_Please_**: not all of the above week. These can be in the form of screenshares (video), screenshots (images), text (markdown), hypertext (html), pictures of handwriting, links to git commit messages, console.logs, voice messages. Also a good place to reflect on any readings. Try different modes throughout the quarter. 

These are due every week in addition to other due dates.

### The Clock(s)

Design a “visual clock” that displays a novel or unconventional representation of the time. Your clock should appear different at all times of the day, and it should repeat its appearance every 24 hours (or other relevant cycle, if desired). Challenge yourself to convey the time without numerals.

You are encouraged to question basic assumptions about how time is mediated and
represented. Ponder concepts like biological time (chronobiology), ultradian and infradian rhythms, solar and lunar cycles, celestial time and sidereal time, decimal time, metric time, geological time, historical time, psychological
time, \[[queer time](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/93357/external_content.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), [crip time](https://dsq-sds.org/article/id/1565/), and [slug time](https://www.ucsc.edu/campus/mascot/)\]and subjective time. Inform your design by reading about the history of timekeeping systems and devices and their transformative effects on society.

_Prompt from **Code as Creative Medium** by Golan Levin and Tega Brain_ **(my edits in brackets)**


### Recombination

Take an existing media object or artwork and, using code, transform it in signficant ways that make it your own. This can involve (mis)translation, parody, collage, excerpting, recontextualization, and/or justaposition.

### Research

Select an existing work of creative code that was made prior to 2021 and in  approximately 1000 words, analyze the work. This analysis should include some understanding (through looking at source code if available, and/or informed speculation) the mechanics of the software in addition to the piece's meaning and how you experienced it. You are welcome to include screenshots. Please format this research in the markdown (.md) format. (You may also choose to 'recombine' this work for that assignment)

### ???

Pick any assignment from _Code as Creative Medium_ (in the files section) 

OR write your own assignment prompt and follow it (to be approved by Teaching Assistant or Instructor)

## Final Exam

The final exam will be a short one-on-one virtual meeting with the instructor or teaching assistant in which you will walk through the code of one of your assignments and answer questions about it.

## Course Schedule

We will be meeting twice a week on zoom. We'll be spending about half the time learning and discussing and half the time coworking. 

The general arc of the class will be 4 weeks of p5js and 6 weeks of JavaScript (and the HTML5 DOM).

At this time, we would also like us to discuss ways we can ensure your full participation in the course. We encourage all students who may benefit from learning more about DRC services to contact DRC by phone at 831-459-2089 or by email at drc@ucsc.edu. More information on disability and accommodation resources may be found at <http://ada.ucsc.edu/>.
 
#### Academic Integrity & Intellectual Property

Academic integrity in the arts requires transparency about your process in producing creative work, scholarship, and other responses to course materials and assignments. When any student makes false or misleading claims regarding their roles in authorship, participation, engagement, and other forms of work, they will be subject to the University’s Academic Misconduct policies and procedures. All students should familiarize themselves with University policy on these topics, including information at <https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html>. When in doubt about the meaning and/or application of these policies in this course, students are responsible to seek answers via direct communication with the instructor. If you aren't sure, just ask!
 
The materials in this course are the intellectual property of their creators. As a student, you have access to many of the materials in the course for the purpose of learning, engaging with your peers in the course, completing assignments, and so on. You have a moral and legal obligation to respect the rights of others by only using course materials for purposes associated with the course. For instance, you are not permitted to share, upload, stream, sell, republish, share the login information for, or otherwise disseminate any of the course materials, such as: video and audio files, assignment prompts, slides, notes, syllabus, simulations, datasets, discussion threads. Conversely, any materials created solely by you (for example, your videos, essays, images, audio files, annotations, notes) are your intellectual property and you may use them as you wish.
 
#### Title IX

Title IX prohibits gender discrimination, including sexual harassment, domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. If you have experienced sexual harassment or sexual violence, you can receive confidential support and advocacy at the Campus Advocacy Resources & Education (CARE) Office by calling (831) 502-2273. In addition, Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) can provide confidential counseling support, (831) 459-2628. You can also report gender discrimination directly to the University’s Title IX Office, (831) 459-2462. Reports to law enforcement can be made to UCPD (831) 459-2231 ext. 1. For emergencies call 911.
 
Faculty and Teaching Assistants are required under the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment to inform the Title IX Office should they become aware that you or any other student has experienced sexual violence or sexual harassment. Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. The goal is to make sure that you are aware of the range of options available to you and that you have access to the resources you need.
 
#### Justice, Equity, Inclusion
Numerous campus resources offer support and grievance channels for students concerned about potential injustice, inequity, or exclusionary practices. The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion <https://diversity.ucsc.edu/index.html> provides resources for students experiencing or observing discrimination, and assists campus partners in cultivating a healthy campus climate in which all students, staff and faculty are treated respectfully and able to thrive and succeed; and everyone including current affiliates, alumni, supporters and community members is welcomed.Students concerned about bias, exclusion, or discrimination may report potential instances at <https://biasresponse.ucsc.edu/>. Please consult resources at the Title IX Office (see above) to report or raise concerns about gender discrimination or harassment, violence, or bullying on the basis of gender and sexuality; the CARE Office <https://care.ucsc.edu/> offers additional resources for survivors of gender- and sexuality-based violence and harassment. The Arts Division is committed to powerful outcomes in the pursuit of justice, equity, and inclusion; more information about those commitments is at <https://arts.ucsc.edu/page/arts-division-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dei-statement>.
 
#### Harassment, bias, and bullying
The University of California, Santa Cruz expressly prohibits students from engaging in conduct constituting unlawful discrimination, harassment or bias. In keeping with the UCSC Principles of Community, we expect students and their guests to refrain from any acts or behaviors that are directed at other members of the campus community, and that result in unlawful discrimination, harassment or bias for an individual or group, and/or that substantially disrupt University operations or interfere with the rights of others. The campus does not seek to limit freedom of speech but rather strives to ensure that all members of the campus community are able to participate in University programs and activities to the fullest extent possible.
 
#### Anti-Racism and Racial Justice
Students encountering, or concerned about, racial injustice, race-based harassment or discrimination, or race-based hate speech and action should make reports to <https://biasresponse.ucsc.edu>, and may wish to consult additional campus anti-racism resources at <https://diversity.ucsc.edu/committees-and-initiatives/antiracism.html>. Creative Technologies is committed to measurable, and accountable action against direct and systemic racism, including specific resources to mitigate and combat anti-black racism. Campus resources and communities in which to cultivate that work include the UC Santa Cruz Center for Racial Justice <https://crjucsc.com/news-and-events
Links to an external site.>, the Music Department's Justice, Access, Equity, and Diversity Committee, tasked with specific racial justice measures outlined here <https://music.ucsc.edu/news/initiatives-and-commitments-toward-racial-justice>. We welcome students to bring concerns and hold accountable the departments of Performance Play and Design; Music; and Art, in pursuit of direct contributions to anti-racism in the Creative Technologies curriculum and community.
 
#### Educational Opportunity Programs
UC Santa Cruz Office of Educational Opportunity Programs (EOP) aims to provide robust support to 'first-generation', low-income, and socioeconomically underserved students, and other students from historically marginalized backgrounds, toward attainment of academic, professional, and personal goals, and to cultivate broad higher-education accessibility, and leadership opportunities among those students. More information is available at <https://eop.ucsc.edu/>, and at <https://firstgen.ucsc.edu/index.html>.
 
#### All-gender restrooms
Many students at UCSC face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.
 
#### Slug Support Program
College can be a challenging time for students and during times of stress it is not always easy to find the help you need. Slug Support can give help with everything from basic needs (housing, food, or financial insecurity) to getting the technology you need during remote instruction. To get started with SLUG Support, please contact the Dean of Students Office at 831-459-4446 or you may send us an email at deanofstudents@ucsc.edu.
