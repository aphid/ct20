## Course Description

Introduction to basic programming skills, including computer language tools and visual-interface programming tools for creative expression. Introduction to web authoring, image creation and editing, sound editing, and user experience design fundamentals, through skills acquisition-focused approach to individual and/or collaborative creative project(s). The final project is a work of playable media art/design, documentary media, interactive journalism/pedagogy/curation, or multi-media art/performance. Languages and applications will vary by instructor.

## Learning Objectives

**Digital Literacy (Introduced)**

Gain literacy in creative tools for digital expression, and in the effective use of technology in arts and design: including digital platforms and algorithms, AI- and algorithmic arts and design tools, and emerging technology in a variety of media.

**Strategies for Creative Practice (Introduced)**

Learn strategies for bringing complex work to completion, individually and collaboratively, across a variety of media, including written, image- and sound-based, performance-based, and socially engaged media.

## Grading Policy/Assessment

This course will focus on _qualitative_ not quantitative assessment, something we’ll discuss during the class, both with reference to your own work and the works we’re studying. While you will get a final grade at the end of the term, we will not be assigning numeric or alphabetic grades to individual assignments, but rather asking questions and making comments that engage your work rather than simply evaluate it. You will also be reflecting carefully on your own work. The intention here is to help you focus on working in a more organic way, as opposed to working as you think you’re expected to. If you are worried about your grade, your best strategy should be to participate in class, do the readings, and complete the assignments. You should consider this course a “busy-work-free zone.” If an assignment does not feel productive, come to office hours and we can find ways to modify, remix, or repurpose the instructions.

At the midpoint and end of the quarter, you will write a short self assessment of the work you have done to that point and what has/hasn’t worked for you in the course. Answer to the best of your ability and don’t overthink the process. There are no trick questions.

If this process causes more anxiety than it alleviates, come to office hours at any point to confer with me or the Teaching Assistant about your progress. 

## Course Materials

Aside from your computer, none of the resources needed for this class should cost any money. All course requirements can be made using free, open source tools and services. Readings will either be made available in the files section or from the below open access texts.


*   **Primary Texts and Media**
    * [Code as Creative Medium]() by Golan Levin and Tega Brain
    * [Aesthetic Programming](https://www.openhumanitiespress.org/books/titles/aesthetic-programming/) by Winnie Soon and Geoff Cox

## Student Responsibilities

### Attendence

Attendance will be taken at class meetings. Your presence is expected and required. Coding is very often done in isolation. One of the benefits of this class is the experience of sharing and engaging with each other's work, collaborating on projects (optionally), and helping each other when we end up out in the weeds with a technical or conceptual problem. Participation can also happen in the class chatroom (on matrix) during or outside of set course times. 

**More than two unexcused absences will impact your grade.** 

### Readings & Resources

I've included some short readings that give important context to the tools and techniques we're looking at. I've also assigned videos, most of which are from Dan Schiffman's Coding Train. These videos are more for reference; if you learn well from watching this kind of thing and appreciate them, by all means watch them all. But if you learn better from experimentation or reading documentation, do what works for you (the videos will always be there if you need to reinforce a concept). 

### Participation

The most obvious opportunity for participation is during our course discussions and critiques during class meetings (whether vocally or using the chat), however participation can also occur in our online spaces.

### Camera Policy

Creative Technologies policy is for students to have their camera on during class time.

When coworking (something we'll be doing quite a bit of), you don't need to share your camera, however: I would like you to share the text editor you're coding in (Zoom does allow us to all share screens simultaneously). This is less about me surveilling your activity than about fostering a community where we can see and comment on each other's work, like in a drawing class where one can walk around the room and see how others interpret the same material in different ways. This is an opportunity for peer learning and troubleshooting (i.e., participation).

## Course Assignments

There are four assignments in the course, which are due week 3, week 5, week 7, and week 10. The order in which you complete the assignments is up to you. There is also a final exam.

### Weekly Documentation/Reflections

Brief articulations of what you've been up to in the class. Document progress, difficulty, interest, confusion, accomplishments, and/or goals. **_Please_**: not all of the above week. These can be in the form of screenshares (video), screenshots (images), text (markdown), hypertext (html), pictures of handwriting, links to git commit messages, console.logs, voice messages. Also a good place to reflect on any readings. Try different modes throughout the quarter. 

These are due every week in addition to other due dates.

### The Clock(s)

Design a “visual clock” that displays a novel or unconventional representation of the time. Your clock should appear different at all times of the day, and it should repeat its appearance every 24 hours (or other relevant cycle, if desired). Challenge yourself to convey the time without numerals.

You are encouraged to question basic assumptions about how time is mediated and
represented. Ponder concepts like biological time (chronobiology), ultradian and infradian rhythms, solar and lunar cycles, celestial time and sidereal time, decimal time, metric time, geological time, historical time, psychological
time, and subjective time. Inform your design by reading about the history of timekeeping systems and devices and their transformative effects on society.

_Prompt from **Code as Creative Medium** by Golan Levin and Tega Brain_


### Recombination

Take an existing media object or artwork and, using code, transform it in signficant ways that make it your own. This can involve (mis)translation, parody, collage, excerpting, recontextualization, justaposition...

### Research

Select an existing work of creative code that was made prior to 2021 and in  approximately 1000 words, analyze the work. This analysis should include some understanding (through looking at source code if available, and/or informed speculation) the mechanics of the software in addition to the piece's meaning and how you experienced it. You are welcome to include screenshots. Please format this research in the markdown (.md) format. (You may also choose to 'recombine' this work for that assignment)

### ???

Pick any assignment from _Code as Creative Medium_ (in the files section) 

OR write your own assignment prompt and follow it (to be approved by Teaching Assistant or Instructor)

## Final Exam

The final exam will be a short one-on-one virtual meeting with the instructor or teaching assistant in which you will walk through the code of one of your assignments and answer questions about it.

## Course Schedule

We will be meeting twice a week on zoom. We'll be spending about half the time learning and discussing and half the time coworking. 

The general arc of the class will be 4 weeks of p5js and 6 weeks of JavaScript (and the HTML5 DOM).

Next quarter, in CT 120, we'll continue with JS, HTML5, and CSS and also be working with some server-side code.
